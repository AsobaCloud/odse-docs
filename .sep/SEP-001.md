# SEP-001: Add top-level ERP Integration section

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-25
**Project:** odse-docs

## Summary
Create a top-level ERP Integration section in the sidebar nav with parent page and two child pages (ERP Enrichment Schemas, Maintenance Event Triage), mirroring the Building/LLM Integration pattern

## Motivation
ERP enrichment content was scattered across Reference and Patterns sections instead of having its own integration section like Building and LLM Integration

## Proposed Change
New parent page docs/erp-integration.md, sidebar nav section in _layouts/default.html, re-parent two child pages

## Acceptance Criteria
ERP Integration section appears in sidebar between LLM Integration and Contributing with both child links; child pages removed from Reference and Patterns sub-menus
